# Cylinder Record Notes

This repository contains information on cylinder records, with an eye
towards replicating the cases they came in.

Descriptions of physical records may be found in [Notes from the ARSC](ARSC-Cylinder-Records.pdf), originally obtained from the [ARSC](https://www.arsc-audio.org/journals/v26/v26n2p133-161.pdf).

3D models may be found in (Cylinder Record-Body.FCStd)[Cylinder Record-Body.FCStd], which requires [FreeCAD](https://www.freecadweb.org/) to edit.

You can view this file on Github by looking at [Cylinder Record-Body.stl](Cylinder Record-Body.stl).
